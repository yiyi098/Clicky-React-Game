### Overview

This is memory game made with React.js. It's an exercise to demo the application's UI, which is separated into components that manage component state and respond to user events.

This game renders different character images randomly to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

The user's score incrementes when an image is clicked for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game also restarts.
